The mandatory feature in the web application is the login and sign in page with a feature for Sign in with Google. There should also be two types of user- admin and non admin.
You are free to work on any project of your choice as long as you have the mandatory features. The more features your application has higher the chances of your induction.
If you only know front-end that is not an issue. You can develop an application without a backend. Backend developers just design a normal looking web pages (don't focus too much on the design). There is no preference for full stack developer as such if you are really good at either of the two you should be good to go. Your projects must have requirements.txt file and a file with a clear instruction on how to run your project. You also need to upload your project on your github. You have time till Saturday 11:59 PM. I will float a Google form on Saturday where you will be asked to send link to your project. I would highly appreciate (though not mandatory) if you could also maybe deploy the project (you can use free services like heroku).
